## Android Application

Our team has developed an android application or to help the university students exchange information, form organizations/clubs, buy/sell/trade goods, and provide a means for profiting from your product (i.e. via selling ad space). Our app is not just for UTA students. It is meant for any university/college students who are looking to engage with their universities by joining clubs, group messaging and many more. The system includes following features. 

- Registration: Students must register before they can use the system. University ID can be used as member Id.
- Login: Members must login to use the system after initial registration.
- Payments: System should be able to handle payments (Credit cards only; You do not need to actually validate credit cards for this project, just make them 16 digits long)
- Form Clubs: System should allow members to form specific organizations or clubs (e.g.chess club, math club, European students club, etc.).
- Buy and Sell: System should allow for buy/sell/lend/exchange of merchandise (e.g.books, household items such as TVs, furniture, etc.).
- Tutoring service: Members should be able to offer their tutoring services or seek a tutor using this system. Appropriate details such as tutoring areas (e.g. tutor for programing languages, Tennis or Piano lessons, etc.), price, schedule, tutor reviews must be included.
- Communication: System should allow for sending messages/e-mails to a single, subgroup or all members (e.g. Free Pizza at 12 in ERB 500, free movie showing in the student center, a great restaurant just opened next door, chess club tournament begins next week)
- Information Exchange: Exchange information about any topic, of course appropriate and within legal boundaries of a university setting such as: job postings, company hiring, class information, tutoring service, attending graduate programs, conference information, job fairs, subleasing apartments, sharing rides, etc. (anything goes)
- Search: You should be able to search for events or items.
- Advertisements: System should provide advertising space (e.g. Local subway store offers specials or coupons to members). This could be a source of revenue from the app.
